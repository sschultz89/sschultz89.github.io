# 10-701 Fall 2017

## Course Description:

Machine learning studies the question How can we build computer programs that automatically 
improve their performance through experience? This includes learning to perform many types 
of tasks based on many types of experience. For example, it includes robots learning to better 
navigate based on experience gained by roaming their environments, medical decision aids that 
learn to predict which therapies work best for which diseases based on data mining of 
historical health records, and speech recognition systems that learn to better 
understand your speech based on experience listening to you. 
This course is designed to give PhD students a thorough grounding in the methods, 
mathematics and algorithms needed to do research and applications in machine learning. 
Students entering the class with a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, 
statistics and algorithms will be at an advantage, but the class has been designed so that 
anyone with a strong numerate background can catch up and fully participate.
